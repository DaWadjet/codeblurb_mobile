## Developing a Multiplatform Software Engineer Interview Preparation Platform With Flutter And React

This repository hosts the mobile client implementation of my Master's thesis at BME-VIK. The thesis documentation is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

The web client's code is also accessible under [codeblurb_web](https://github.com/DaWadjet/codeblurb_web).

The webapp - at least at the time of writing - is accessible at <https://codeblurb-492f1.web.app/>
